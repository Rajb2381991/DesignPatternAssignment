1=>  Create Sorter Abstract Class With Abstract Methods as GetSortedList() and
     DisplayList() Which Uses The Interface Chassis.

2=>  Chassis Interface Will Implemented With GetPrice() and GetPowerComsumption()
     Methods For Investigating Equipment Properties.

3=> Chassis Interface Implemented By Bus , CPU , FloopyDrive Classes.

4=> Finally The Abstract Class Sorter Will Provide The Sorted List Of Equipements
    With Defined Algorithm.
